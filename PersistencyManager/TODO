Copy data when only one segment of a node is replaced:
    1- patch NetManager.PreReleaseSegmentImplementation():
        - to make a record of the nodes whose segments is being destroyed.
        - and their current segment lists.
    2- after simulation step:
        - for each node from step 1:
            - compare old segments to new segments to calculate: old, new, still, deleted, added
            - then create map and copy data accordingly.
Copy data when segment is upgrading:       
            - make sure to copy segment data too, this helps when segment is upgrading.

Copy data when node moves:
    - patch MoveMiddle node
    - prefix: make record of node and nearby segments.
    - postfix: if new node is created, then map and paste all data.
